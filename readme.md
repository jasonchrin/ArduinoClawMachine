Arduino Claw Machine

The goal of this project is to build a claw machine and be able to control it via a joystick and eventually over the web.

The machine frame is based around an Ultimaker Plus 3d printer.  

I'm anticipating having the machine being driven by an Arudino MEGA and have a Raspberry Pi3 in place once I add video streaming and webcontrol.

I want to build something fun and learn something along the way.
