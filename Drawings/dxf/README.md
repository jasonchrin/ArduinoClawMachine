# Ultimaker-Original-Plus
Bill of Materials and parts for UM-original +

In this repository you will find the documentation and source files for all parts in the Ultimaker-Original+ 3D printer. In the Bill Of Materials (BOM) repository all the parts are numbered and named with the correct amounts. The parts can be found in all the separate directories. 

A lot of parts are lasercut. In the BOM these are marked by the blue colour. The lasercut files can be found separately in the laser file directory. The electronic files can be found in the directory 1091 main board V2.1.1; 1146 ultipanel rev 1.1 and 1155 Print Table Heated Bed.

The manual will explain how to put all files together. 

If you are missing a part or information feel free to file an issue on github.
